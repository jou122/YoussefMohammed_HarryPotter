# Hermione's potion
### Solving algorithm 
For this problem we used ..... 

well I improvised it since I couldn't find much material for the Timer library

I used attachInterrupt to read the change on the button bin once then call the timer every  for each task required except heat I used oscillate

But Here where it got complicated for me I used oscillate again to blink for five and ten seconds 

I wanted to but an end to the code so I set a variable for the potion time  where when it end it kill all timer instances which I didn't like as it looked stupid but I had a Written suggestion in this part at the code

Fortunately (and unfortunately at the same time) this was the only code I can test since I have all the Components required so I am sure it works (It is little stupid but it works )
