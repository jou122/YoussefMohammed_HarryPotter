# Ron's Broomstick 
## solving algorithm 

so for this particular problem which I didn't attend its session for some personal issues was pretty difficult for me to understand so I referenced that video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCyRXMvVSCw 

Installed the library (which took me approximately 4 hours to understand how to implement and which part of the code does calculate the pitch and roll angels )

and then I used the already calculated values to detect the 60 deviation and blink the LED 

I wanted to test but I don't have an IMU on me right now but I am going to buy one just to test it
